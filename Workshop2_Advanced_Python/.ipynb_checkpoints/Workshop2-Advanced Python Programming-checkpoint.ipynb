    "### Using `pdb` for Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pdb` module in Python is a built-in tool that lets you **pause your program** at any point and **inspect what’s happening**. It's like hitting the \"pause\" button in the middle of your code so you can take a closer look.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How `pdb` Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting a Breakpoint**:\n",
    "   - A **breakpoint** tells your code to pause at a specific line during execution.\n",
    "   - You can set a breakpoint using `pdb.set_trace()`. This will pause the program and allow you to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interacting with Your Code**:\n",
    "   - After the code pauses, you can:\n",
    "     - Check the values of variables.\n",
    "     - Step through the code line by line.\n",
    "     - Continue the program or quit the debugging session.\n",
    "   - Commands:\n",
    "     - `p variable`: Print the value of a variable.\n",
    "     - `n`: Move to the next line of code.\n",
    "     - `c`: Continue running the program.\n",
    "     - `q`: Quit the debugger and stop the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Use `pdb`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insert a Breakpoint**:\n",
    "   Add `pdb.set_trace()` at the line where you want the program to pause.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pdb\n",
    "   pdb.set_trace()  # Pauses the program here\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Program**: When the program reaches the breakpoint, it will pause, and you can start interacting with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inspect and Control the Program**: After the program pauses, you can check variable values, move through the code step by step, and decide whether to continue or quit."

    "### Best Practices for Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Catch specific exceptions**:  \n",
    "   Always catch specific exceptions (e.g., `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`) rather than catching all exceptions using a generic `except:`. This helps in understanding exactly what went wrong and allows for more precise error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provide useful error messages**:  \n",
    "   When handling exceptions, provide meaningful error messages to help the user understand what went wrong. Avoid generic messages like \"An error occurred.\" Instead, give clear information that can guide users to correct their input or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid using try-except for flow control**:  \n",
    "   Use try-except blocks for **error handling**, not for controlling the normal flow of your program. The try-except mechanism should be used to catch unexpected issues, not as part of the regular logic flow of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use finally for cleanup**:  \n",
    "   If your code requires any kind of **cleanup** (e.g., closing files or network connections), use the `finally` block. Code inside the `finally` block will run **no matter what**, whether an exception was raised or not. This ensures that resources are released properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Code that runs no matter what (e.g., closing a file)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Keep try blocks short:**\n",
    "Keep the code inside the try block as small as possible. This makes it easier to pinpoint where the error occurred and ensures that you're not masking potential issues by having too much code inside a single try block. Only include the lines that are likely to cause an exception.\n"

    "## Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is a **linear data structure** that follows the principle of **Last In, First Out (LIFO)**. This means that the **last** element added to the stack is the **first** one to be removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Push**: Adding an item to the top of the stack.\n",
    "- **Pop**: Removing the item from the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stacks](https://logicmojo.com/assets/dist/new_pages/images/stack-in-data-structure.webp)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Stacks can be visualized like a stack of plates, where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be taken off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use a Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are useful when you need to **reverse the order of operations** or **keep track of execution** in a nested manner. Some common use cases for stacks include:\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: In algorithms that explore possibilities (e.g., solving a maze), you can use a stack to remember the steps you've taken.\n",
    "- **Undo operations**: Text editors or graphic software use stacks to **undo** recent actions. Every action (e.g., typing, drawing) is pushed onto the stack, and when you click \"Undo\", the most recent action is popped off.\n",
    "- **Function calls**: In programming, function calls are managed via a **call stack**. Each time a function is called, its state is pushed onto the stack. When the function ends, its state is popped off the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples of Stacks in Daily Life\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Browser History**: Web browsers implement a stack to keep track of the pages you visit. Every time you click on a link, the current page is pushed onto the stack. When you hit the \"Back\" button, the most recent page is popped off, and you're returned to the previous one.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Undo Feature in Applications**: Applications like **Microsoft Word** or **Photoshop** use stacks to handle undo operations. Each time you make a change, it gets added to the stack. When you press \"Undo\", the most recent change is popped from the stack, allowing you to revert to the previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plates in a Restaurant**: Think about a stack of plates in a cafeteria. You place plates on top of each other. The plate that was placed last is the first to be taken off. This is a perfect example of **Last In, First Out (LIFO)**.\n"

    "### Problem: Implementing an \"Undo\" Feature in a Word Processor\n",
    "\n",
    "As a developer working on a new word processor, you need to create an **undo** feature that allows users to backtrack their actions step by step. This feature is crucial for improving user experience, enabling them to revert changes they made, such as typing text, deleting content, or formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is ideal for implementing an undo feature because of its **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** nature. The most recent action performed by the user (e.g., typing a word, formatting text) is the first action they would want to undo. The stack will help us keep track of these actions in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Push**: Every time the user performs an action (e.g., typing a word), we push that action onto the stack.\n",
    "- **Pop**: When the user clicks \"Undo\", we pop the last action from the stack and reverse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Undo Feature Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Push Operations**: \n",
    "   - When the user types or performs an action, we **push** that action onto the stack.\n",
    "   - Example: Typing a word like `\"Hello\"` will push the action `(\"type\", \"Hello\")` onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pop Operations**: \n",
    "   - When the user clicks \"Undo\", we **pop** the last action from the stack.\n",
    "   - Example: If the last action was typing `\"Hello\"`, undoing will remove `\"Hello\"` from the content."

    "\n",
    "### What is a Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **queue** is a **linear data structure** that follows the principle of **First In, First Out (FIFO)**. This means that the **first** element added to the queue is the **first** one to be removed. Queues are similar to lines at a store: the first person in line is the first to be served.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enqueue**: Adding an element to the back of the queue.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use a Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues are used when **order matters**, and the sequence in which data is processed or retrieved needs to match the order in which it was added. Queues are ideal in scenarios where:\n",
    "- You need to manage tasks in the order they were added.\n",
    "- You need to process requests or items **sequentially**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Examples in Daily Life\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Waiting in Line (Queue at a Store)**:\n",
    "   - When you stand in line at a store or bank, the first person in line is served first. Everyone is served in the order they arrived. This is a perfect example of **First In, First Out (FIFO)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Task Scheduling**:\n",
    "   - In computer systems, the operating system manages multiple tasks or processes. It uses a **queue** to manage these processes, ensuring they are executed in the order they were added to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customer Service**:\n",
    "   - In customer service systems, like call centers, incoming calls are placed in a queue. The first customer to call will be the first to get assistance, while others wait in line.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Printer Queue**:\n",
    "   - When you send multiple print jobs to a printer, they are processed in the order they were sent. The first document in the queue gets printed first."
