Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n.. dropdown:: References\\n\\n  - Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n    Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n    Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n  - Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.

    "\n",
    "## What is FastAPI?\n",
    "Think of FastAPI as a translator between your machine learning model and users. It allows people to send data to the model (like asking it questions) and receive responses back, all through the web. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) using Python. It’s designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for deploying machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI enables us to expose our machine learning model as a **REST API**, making it accessible to other applications or users over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a REST API?\n",
    "A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standardized way to build and interact with web services. REST APIs use HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to define actions for interacting with resources on a server. They provide a structured and predictable way to communicate between a client (e.g., a user or an application) and a server, allowing data to be transferred in a standardized format like JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of deploying a machine learning model, a REST API acts as an intermediary that enables other applications to interact with the model by sending requests and receiving predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed**: FastAPI is highly optimized for performance, making it suitable for real-time applications. It’s built on ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), allowing asynchronous request handling, which contributes to its high speed and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: FastAPI has a clean, intuitive design that makes it simple to set up, requiring minimal code to create robust APIs. It’s also compatible with standard Python data types, making data handling straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation automatically using tools like Swagger and Redoc. This documentation is helpful for testing the API endpoints and understanding how to interact with them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "With FastAPI, we can quickly create an interface for our machine learning model that makes it accessible to users and applications in a reliable, structured way.\n"

    "# What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is like a portable box that contains everything your model needs to run. With Docker, you can ship the box anywhere (your laptop, a cloud server, etc.) and be confident it will work the same way. Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows you to package applications along with their dependencies in isolated environments, known as **containers**. This ensures that your application will run consistently across different environments (e.g., on different computers or servers) because all the required software and configurations are bundled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Docker containers ensure that the application runs identically across different environments. This eliminates the \"it works on my machine\" problem, as all dependencies are included within the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Each container operates independently, which prevents conflicts with other applications or services on the same system. This isolation helps in managing multiple applications or versions of applications on a single system without interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Containers make it easy to scale applications across multiple servers. Docker allows efficient management of multiple instances, making it ideal for scaling up applications to meet demand.\n",

    "### Real-Time API Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this deployment, we’re serving a machine learning model as an API endpoint using FastAPI, allowing the model to process predictions in real time when a user sends a request. **Docker** will package our FastAPI application, making it easy to deploy on various platforms without worrying about compatibility issues.\n",

    "- **Docker**: Packages the application and its environment, ensuring consistent deployment across different servers or platforms. With Docker, we don’t have to worry about compatibility issues, as all dependencies and configurations are encapsulated within the container.\n",

    "Now, we move to `.py` code files in a compiler (like Visual Studio Code or even a simple text editor). Here’s why `.py` files are preferred over Jupyter Notebooks for building and deploying FastAPI applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear and Organized Code Structure**  \n",
    "   - `.py` files keep code clean and organized, making it easy to read, maintain, and understand. Unlike Notebooks, they’re meant for complete, standalone applications rather than experimenting or testing ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better for Deployment**  \n",
    "   - `.py` files are ready to run on servers. They don’t rely on Jupyter’s interactive features, which aren’t designed for production environments. Running a `.py` file directly (with `uvicorn`, for example) is faster, more reliable, and better for real-world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Works Well with Deployment Tools (like Docker and CI/CD)**  \n",
    "   - Deployment tools like Docker, which help package and run apps, work easily with `.py` files. In contrast, Notebooks add extra steps and complications to these setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simpler Error Handling**  \n",
    "   - It’s easier to spot and handle errors in `.py` files since you can use logging and monitoring tools that work best with standalone scripts. Notebooks, on the other hand, can hide or complicate error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Native Async Support**  \n",
    "   - FastAPI uses async code to handle multiple requests at once. `.py` files support async directly, while Notebooks need workarounds to handle async code, which can make development harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Better for Collaboration and Version Control**  \n",
    "   - `.py` files are easy to track and version using tools like Git. They’re simple to review, share, and update, which makes teamwork smoother. Notebooks, with their cell-based format, can be harder to track and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, moving to `.py` files keeps your code ready for production, easier to manage, and better suited for professional development workflows."
