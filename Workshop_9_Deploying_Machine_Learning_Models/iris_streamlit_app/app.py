# Streamlit is an open-source Python library that transforms data scripts into interactive web applications,
# ideal for deploying machine learning models. Its simplicity allows for rapid prototyping, integrating
# real-time input handling, visualizations, and pre-built UI elements (like sliders and buttons) without 
# requiring web development skills. With easy integration of popular Python libraries and flexible hosting options,
# Streamlit enables accessible and collaborative sharing of ML models with stakeholders.

# Streamlit and FastAPI serve different purposes, though both are excellent tools for deploying ML models.
# Streamlit is designed for rapid prototyping with minimal code, focusing on building interactive, user-friendly 
# web applications with built-in UI components (like sliders, buttons, and graphs) ideal for data science and ML demos.
# It requires no HTML or CSS, making it accessible for data scientists without a web development background.

# FastAPI, on the other hand, is a high-performance framework for building robust APIs with asynchronous support.
# It is better suited for production-grade applications where backend API endpoints are needed, such as serving
# complex ML models for high-load environments. FastAPI is more flexible for custom endpoints and integrations
# with other web technologies but requires additional tools (like frontend frameworks) to build a complete web UI.

# In short, Streamlit is typically better for quick, interactive ML model demos and user interfaces, while FastAPI 
# excels in building scalable, production-ready API services with high-performance requirements.

# The `st.set_page_config()` function in Streamlit is used to set up the initial configuration for the web app.
# Here, the page title is set to "Iris Flower Classifier", which will appear in the browser tab.
# The `page_icon` parameter assigns a flower emoji üå∏ as the favicon in the browser tab.
# `layout="centered"` centers the content on the page, making it visually balanced, especially for small datasets or simple interfaces.
# `initial_sidebar_state="expanded"` ensures the sidebar is visible by default, providing easy access to options or inputs for users.
# Overall, this configuration enhances the user experience with a clean and organized layout.

# The `@st.cache_resource` decorator is used to cache the output of the `load_model()` function.
# This means that the model will only be loaded once, reducing loading time on subsequent calls and improving performance.
# Caching is particularly useful for large or complex models, as it avoids reloading the model every time the app reruns.
# Here, `load_model()` loads the pre-trained Iris classifier from the 'iris_classifier.pkl' file using `joblib`.
# When `model = load_model()` is called, it retrieves the cached model, ensuring efficient and fast access for predictions.

# The `user_input_features()` function captures input values for each feature required by the Iris classifier model.

# The default values (e.g., 5.4 for sepal length) serve as initial inputs when the app loads.
